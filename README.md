# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer

# Introduction
Welcome to the world of Handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow! In this interactive demo, we will explore the fascinating realm of machine learning and deep neural networks to create a model that can identify handwritten digits. Whether you're a beginner just getting started with machine learning or a seasoned data scientist looking to dive into TensorFlow, you're in for an exciting journey.

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It involves teaching a computer to distinguish and classify hand-drawn digits, such as those found in zip codes, addresses, or even mathematical equations. The ability to automatically recognize handwritten digits has a wide range of practical applications, from digitizing documents to enabling automation in various industries.

# Getting Started

To begin your journey into the world of Handwritten Digits Recognition, you'll need to set up your environment and acquire the necessary dependencies. Here's how you can get started:

# Install Dependencies

Step 1: Clone the Repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/alexchancs/Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
  cd Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
  ```

Step 2: Upgrade pip and Install Dependencies

Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest version of pip, and then install the   required Python packages:
  ```
  pip3 install --upgrade pip
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Now that you have the project and its dependencies installed, you're ready to explore and use the Handwritten Digits Recognizer.

# Training The Model

In this section, you'll dive into the process of training your very own handwritten digits recognition model. But before we get into the nitty-gritty of the training process, let's introduce the concept.

Training a machine learning model involves teaching it to recognize patterns and make predictions. In this case, you'll train your model to recognize handwritten digits, such as those you might find on a piece of paper. To do this, we will employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful type of neural network specifically designed for image-related tasks

Step 3: Run the Training Script:

Once you're ready to train your model, execute the following command:
  ```
  python3 cnn.py
  ```
This command will initiate the training process, and your model will start learning to identify handwritten digits from a dataset. Once the training is complete, you'll have a trained model ready to be used for recognition tasks.



# Implement The Model
Now that you've trained your model, it's time to implement it and put it to the test.

In this section, you'll experience the practical application of your model through an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI). You can draw your own digits and watch as the model identifies and classifies them with impressive accuracy.

Stay tuned for the next steps where you will delve into implementing and interacting with your trained model in the GUI.
